<br>

<h2 align="center">üìõ Legal Disclaimer üìõ
</h2>
<br>

- We suggest you to use your `Own MongoDB URL` while deploying inside `.env` or `Environment Variables`. That will increase your Privacy and Security.
- We don't recommend to change the `Command databases like rpg and economy` that we have added in our bot. `If you do so, you will be responsible for any issues and we will not provide any support if we are busy`.

- We prefer that you should not do anything with the aurora.js as it is the main file of the bot which in return can harm your bot.
- Always try to avoid command spamming by making it private mode or banning spammers in order to save your bot from ban.
- Do not add or update any dependencies it is required as every dependencies has its own compability with others.
- Try to use our official api from our api repo.
